What is this?

A manual collection of tech logos.

Why?

I use this to build my [resume](moo-mou/resume).

Cool. How do I use this?

You should use the Github API to fetch the image and either cache those request or convert the result to base64 for your use.

    Example

        api.github.com/repos/moo-mou/logo/contents/database/redis.png

Please! If you would like to expand the logo available, please submit a pull request.

All images should be PNG and be less than 1MB in size. Ideally with transparent background and as "emblematic" as possible.
